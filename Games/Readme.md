## Tamagotchi

You will beable to play and feed pets(dogs, cats and poodles) as well as ask them to make asound. They will leave if they are bored or hungry for too long. This will end theprogram. You will start with a partially implemented game that has some functions,parts of the player menuand the pet class implemented anddocumented. Buildingwell designed sub classes for dogs, cats and poodles is up to you.

The basic gameplay is as follows:

1.The user is prompted for what kind of pet to adopt.

2.The user is prompted for the pet’s name.

3.The user is prompted for what sound the pet makes(e.g.,“woof”,“meow”,“yo”)

4.Game play begins:
  
  a. At each turn, the user issues a command(“speak”,“play”,“feed”, or“wait”)
  
  b. Depending upon the command, different things will happen, and the pet’shunger and boredom attributes may be lessened.b. Regardless of the command, however, the pet’s    hunger and boredom willincrease, simply because of the passage of time.
  
  c. If a pet becomes too hungry, it will leave to find food elsewhere and the gamewill be over. 
  
  d. If a pet becomes too bored, it will leave to find entertainment elsewhere andthe game will be over.
